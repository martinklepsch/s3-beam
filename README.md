# s3-beam

`s3-beam` is a Clojure/Clojurescript library designed to help you upload files
from the browser to S3 (CORS upload).

```clj
[org.martinklepsch/s3-beam "0.3.0"]
```

## Usage

To upload files directly to S3 you need to send special request
parameters that are based on your AWS credentials, the file name, mime
type, date etc.
Since we **don't want to store our credentials in the client** these
parameters need to be generated on the server side.
For this reason this library consists of two parts:

1. A pluggable route that will send back the required parameters for a
   given file-name & mime-type
2. A client-side core.async pipeline setup that will retrieve the
   special parameters for a given File object, upload it to S3 and
   report back to you

### 1. Enable CORS on your S3 bucket

Please follow Amazon's [official documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html).

### 2. Plug-in the route to sign uploads

```clj
(ns your.server
  (:require [s3-beam.handler :as s3b]
            [compojure.core :refer [GET defroutes]]
            [compojure.route :refer [resources]]))

(def bucket "your-bucket")
(def aws-zone "s3-eu-west-1")
(def access-key "your-aws-access-key")
(def secret-key "your-aws-secret-key")

(defroutes routes
  (resources "/")
  (GET "/sign" {params :params} (s3b/s3-sign bucket aws-zone access-key secret-key)))
```

If you want to use a route different than `/sign`, define it in the
handler, `(GET "/my-cool-route" ...)`, and then pass it in the options
map to `s3-pipe` in the frontend.

### 3. Integrate the upload pipeline into your frontend

In your frontend code you can now use `s3-beam.client/s3-pipe`.
`s3-pipe`'s argument is a channel where completed uploads will be
reported. The function returns a channel where you can put File
objects that should get uploaded. It might also take an extra options
map with the previously mentioned `:server-url` like so:

    (s3/s3-pipe uploaded {:server-url "/my-cool-route"})

An example using it within an Om component:

```clj
(defcomponent upload-form [app-state owner]
  (init-state [_]
    (let [uploaded (chan 20)]
      {:dropped-queue (chan 20)
       :upload-queue (s3/s3-pipe uploaded)
       :uploaded uploaded
       :uploads []}))
  (did-mount [_]
    (listen-file-drop js/document (om/get-state owner :dropped-queue))
    (go (while true
          (let [{:keys [dropped-queue upload-queue uploaded uploads]} (om/get-state owner)]
            (let [[v ch] (alts! [dropped-queue uploaded])]
              (cond
               (= ch dropped-queue) (put! upload-queue v)
               (= ch uploaded) (om/set-state! owner :uploads (conj uploads v))))))))
  (render-state [this state]
    ; ....
    )
```

The `uploaded` channel will return a map with the `:file` object that
was uploaded and a `:response` map that contains the `:location`,
`:bucket`, `:key`, and `:etag` of the file in S3. 

## Changes

#### Not Released

- Added the `:key-fn` option `s3-beam.handler/sign-upload` to generate
  custom S3 keys from `file-name` and `mime-type`.
- **Breaking Change**: the `uploaded` channel now returns a map with
  the `:file` that was uploaded and the S3 `:response` map with itself
  contains all the information necessary to locate the file in S3:
  `:location`, `:key`, `:bucket`, and `:etag` instead of just the
  location as a string.

#### 0.3.0

-  Allow customization of server-side endpoint ([1cb9b27](https://github.com/martinklepsch/s3-beam/commit/1cb9b2703691e172e275a95490b3fc8209dfa409))

        (s3/s3-pipe uploaded {:server-url "/my-cool-route"})

#### 0.2.0

- Allow passing of `aws-zone` parameter to `s3-sign` handler function. ([b880736](https://github.com/martinklepsch/s3-beam/commit/b88073646b7c92b5493a168ce25d27feaa130c9e))

## Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome. There are a few things I'd like to improve:

* **Testing:** currently there are no tests
* **Custom route:** allow use of other routes than `/sign`
* **Error handling:** what happens when the request fails?
* **Upload progress:** XhrIo supports `PROGRESS` events and especially
  for larger uploads it'd be nice to have them
